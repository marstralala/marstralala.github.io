                Being a person full of negativity, I have always thought that I would never meet a person who will stay with me 'til I die. It stuck to my mind that I will be the one who'll be the designated "matandang dalaga" in the family. And that I'll be the designated daughter who'll take care of her parents. I never thought that I'd find this kind of love for me. It's not that I lost hope in finding love, it's just that I've accepted that it is a possibility.
                <br>
                <br>
                All these thoughts were gone since you came. This may be clich√© but you really kind of changed me. I mean I am this realist person - borderline pessimist though - then here you are like a ball of sunshine gleaming with positivity. You gave me the love that I really deserve, and I am beyond thankful for that. Thank you for loving me even on my worst. And I swear to love you with all my heart until the end.
                <br>
                <br>
                Please don't ever change for I love you for who you are. Even when you don't feel like youself, I am here to be with you always. Thank you for all the love you have given me, and I choose to stay to love you back. I will love you even when you can't love youself, for I am herd with you always and forever.
